# 1. Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Overview: 
 Introduction to the Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides a quick overview of the Google Cloud Platform and a deeper dive of the data processing capabilities.

At the end of this course, we will be able to:
• Identify the purpose and value of the key Big Data and Machine Learning products in the Google Cloud Platform
• Use CloudSQL and Cloud Dataproc to migrate existing MySQL and Hadoop/Pig/Spark/Hive workloads to Google Cloud Platform
• Employ BigQuery and Cloud Datalab to carry out interactive data analysis
• Choose between Cloud SQL, BigTable and Datastore
• Train and use a neural network using TensorFlow
• Choose between different data processing products on the Google Cloud Platform

## What is the Google Cloud Platform?
Cloud computing is a continuation of a long-term shift on how computing resources are managed.
- First Wave *[1980 - 2000]* - **Server on-premises**: Each company owns everything, it is their job to manage it.
- Second Wave *[2000 - Now]* - **Data centers**: Companies pay for the hardware but rent the space. It is still theirs to manage.
- First Generation Cloud *[Now - Next]* - **Virtualized data centers**: Companies rent hardware and software, but still control and configure virtual machines. Pay for what they provision.
